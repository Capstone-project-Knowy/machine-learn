# Revise for the Third Version of the Model - Final Models

![KnowyV3-REV_Logo](https://github.com/MarcelTRG/Git-Test/blob/master/Asset/Knowy_Ver3-REV.png)

For the final version of the model, not much different from the original version. The only things that we decided to change was removing the Costum Clustering Layer.

This decision we took, because when we try to Export and Load this model to another Notebooks or different environment it always give an error. Seems when the model was saved without the Costum Clustering Layer. That's why it always experience Error. To simplyfy it we decided to just drop the Costum Clustering Layer itself

This is the final model that we used and Deploy on Knowy :>
