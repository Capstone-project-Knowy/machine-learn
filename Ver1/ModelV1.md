# Our first Try

For our first try in creating the models, we decided to do a simple classification model that can recognize patterns on the data and classify it to a career. First let's take a look at the dataset.

In this model we decided to use a simple classification models. This classification model will read all the data from the dataset, like score on OCEAN Test and Aptitude Test then it will take a new score of OCEAN Test and Aptitude Test to find the career it classify as

After further evaluation, we find that this model had many weird behaviour. Such as Tesr Accuracy is always at 0.0 but when the model trained it did get 71&.
