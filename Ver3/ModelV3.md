# Third Version of the model

The third or final version of the model, we have implementing clustering method for our models. To helps us do Clustering we use several Function from Scikit-learn Library such as StandarScaler and KMeans

We also decide to add some costum clustering layer as shown below

This Costum Clustering Layer was used because we always face an error for any type of Clustering that was given by the function. We already try 'random' and 'linear'. After facing those error we decided to just create a Costum Clustering Layer
