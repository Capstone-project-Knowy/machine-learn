This model was designed after we finish Technical Advisor Meeting. Mostly this design are just testing on using Clustering Method for the data taht we use. Our first model we used Classification Method

AS previously said, this model are just changing things from the first model to apply Clustering Method to the models. Hence why you could see a lot of testing cell

For Clustering Method that was test, its still not applied to the model itself. Just testing it in raw Python. This model become based for improvement to for the third version of the model
